#Dynatrace ACL - DayOne
##  Cloud Navtive Landscap
Industrys Observations.
- Move to Cloud-native architectures wich are faster
- use agile development to release  more oftens
- give developers more operational responsibility
- build process that are focused on collaboration
- Automate resulting in cost efficiencys
### Why
> - Speed of deliver / Agility
> -  Size/Comp
> - elasticty
> - Ownership
> - Stability
> - DevOps

## What high-preforming cloud native & DevOps Compaines Do Well
- 24x more lickely to make monitoring and alrerting econfigration by teams
- 23x more likely to reuse deployment patterns
- 44x more likely to reuse testing patterns
- 44x more likkly to con

### Challenges
- list why you think the problems are
### how may app can you manage
- effort
- noOPS
- traditional operations
- unmangageable siae
### How matrue are we? (Really?)
- 2-week sprints 
- 25x/Year releases
- 200:1 (your mark rating)
- is remediation as fas as deployment?
- - fail faster
- -  how long does it take for the devloper to know how it went into production

### Impact of Lack of Maturity
what issue happen when you can move faster because lack of maturity

## Autonomous Cloud Customer Eamples
- Shift-left: Automated perfomance
- Automate quality gates through coninuous Performance vaildation
- monitoring as code from dev to ops
- - 37% improved slas
- - 3x increased Productivity
-Monitoring as Code Enables Direct Feedback From
- Devlopers Feel Responsible

## Automnomous Cloud @ Dynatrace
- Dynatrace invested into Automous cloud
- - they drink the coolaid and made a better tool because of it
- Speed rules all, you have to devlop faster / smarter
- countiouse improvement rules all
## Autonomous Cloud Management Transforms: BU Goals & Benefits
- Development to release great software
### piromd of ACM
- levels 1- 4
- 1 Autmate Monitoring: Self-Service Monitoring
- 2 Autmate Testing: On-Demand Performance Testing
- 3 Autmate Sofware deeliver: Fully Automated Delivery Pipeline
- 4 Autmate problems Remedation: Self Healing

## ACL Lab it selft
- Day 1
- -  developing Microservice
- -  Cloud-native Concepts
- - Autonomus Cloud Concepts
- Day 2 
- -  Monolith to Microservice
- -  extending Dynatraace: API
- - Extending Dyantrace : Apit (Cont'd)

### Participathion rules
Eliminate Distraction

exercise patience with on another

### Workshop Mode
- introduction to underlying concepts
- - Slides and demos
- Hands-ons training

## Enviorment Zero
- introduction
- sockshop application
- architecture
- lab setup
- - che pre req
- - 
### sochkshop application
- http://socks.weave.works
- opensource microservice app
### Sockshops Architect
- nodejs
- mongodb
- rabbitMQ
- java
- javascripts

### lab setup
- bastion host
- glcloud
- Kubernettes
- docker
- Github
- jenkins
## Full-Stack: Monitoring as a platform feature
- deploy one agent per host (kubectl create)
- auto instrumentation of containerized microservices
- auto distributed transaction tracing
- AI based root Cause analytics
### Operators in kubernaetes: putting operational knowledge into software
- operator framewok
an operator represents human operational knowledge in software,, to reilably manage an application.

### Dynatrace OneAgent operator
- manage dynatrace oneagent deployments
    - fine-grained control of OneAgent deployments to specific nodes
- Perform updates dynatrace oneagent automatically
    - oneagent operator takes care of recyclining all pods not yet updated to latest version
- full integration with read hat container catalog
